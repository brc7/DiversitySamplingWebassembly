# DiversitySampling


## Introduction
This is the diversity sampling tool, but written for webassembly. Webassembly is a compilation target supported by all major browsers. Scientific algorithms run about 10% slower with webassembly bytecode than with natively-compiled C++, but webassembly runs in the browser and is extremely portable.

## Build
Install the emscripten compiler and run the makefile.
